LitzUp Authoring Tool 
======================



Overview
------------
This authoring tool is inspired by the SIGGRAPH17 paper, Lighting Grid Hierarchy for Self-illuminating Explosions, by Can Yuksel and Cem Yuksel. You can access their website using the following link: http://www.cemyuksel.com/research/lgh/.
In a brief summary, the LGH data struct could speed up the path tracing process and produce outputs with fewer noises. 

Implementation
---------
The c++ codes are implemented in Qt, and will eventually be used in Houdini as an authoring tool.
